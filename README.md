Title:

Description:
Create a two dimensional game using the unity game engine. 

Vision Statement: To create an online competitive multiplayer runner game that we all would enjoy to play!

Risks:
  -Lack of experience using the Unity game engine.
  -All group members have busy schedules so may be hard to meet.
    -using slack and video chat in order to communicate.

Mitigation Strategy for dealing with risk:
  -There is ample support documentation and videos meant to aid new Unity users.

Methodology:

For this project the team will most likely use an agile scheme for production. This production scheme seems most beneficial due to the fact that most games are built on layers. AKA there must be a map before a user can move throughout the map.

Project Tracking Software:

For this project we will be using GitHub to maintain version control between members of the team throughout the semester. 
We will be usint PIVOTAL for project tracking. Pivotal is a useful tool because it is able to link your progress to github repositories.

  -What type of Scheduling do you guys think we should use????
