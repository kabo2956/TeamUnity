Methodology:
For this project the team will most likely use an agile scheme for production. This production scheme seems most beneficial due to the fact that most games are built on layers. AKA there must be a map before a user can move throughout the map.

Project Tracking Software:
For this project we will be using GitHub to maintain version control between members of the team throughout the semester. 
We will be usint PIVOTAL for project tracking. Pivotal is a useful tool because it is able to link your progress to github repositories.
  -What type of Scheduling do you guys think we should use????
